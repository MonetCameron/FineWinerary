# Fine Winerary
The data is sourced from the Wine Quality Data Set (Red & White Wine) on Kaggle. It includes detailed chemical analyses of red and white wines from the Vinho Verde region in Portugal, along with sensory quality ratings provided by wine tasters. This dataset is widely used for exploring relationships between chemical properties and wine quality. 

For this project, I wanted to dive deep into the relationship between wine quality ratings and the chemical components that make up wine. Using the Wine Quality dataset, which includes both red and white wines, I explored how the various elements of a wine—like acidity, sugar levels, alcohol content, and others—relate to the wine’s overall quality score.

The main goal was to see if I could identify patterns or trends in the data that could explain the differences in quality. Once I figured out these connections, I created a threshold or set of criteria that could help with wine selection. Think of it as a way to match wines to your exact preferences based on their chemical makeup—whether you’re looking for a wine to pair with a dinner or just something to enjoy.

This survey is where all that work comes together. You’ll answer a few questions about your taste preferences and what you’re eating, and I’ll use the data to recommend wines that are most likely to meet your needs. Whether you prefer something sweet or dry, light or full-bodied, I’ve got you covered with wine suggestions that align with your preferences. It’s all about combining data and flavor to help you make the best choice!
